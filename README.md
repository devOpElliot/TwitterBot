# TwitterBot

This simple twitter bot allows users to gather data about the use of Twitter in a select location. It stores the data in a sqlite3 database, making statistical references possible for any user. 

## Usage 
Any one can use this bot. You must have npm installed in order to run. 
Once npm is installed, navigate to the directory and run npm install. This will install all dependencies. 
You must then go to twitter and either create a new account to run queries or use your own account. To do this, go to twitter's developer page: https://developer.twitter.com/ 

You must then create an API key and insert the generated keys into the bot.js file. Take a look at the twit repository to gain more insight into how to do this.
